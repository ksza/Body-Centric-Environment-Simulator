EgoSim
==================================

EgoSim is the framework I have developed as part of my Masters' Thesis, An Environment Simulator for Mobile Context-Aware System Design. It enables researchers designing mobile context-aware systems, to simulate their envisioned system, based on the egocentric interaction paradigm. Using this framework, you can import a model of an environment (i.e. an indoors space) and augment it with egocentric data. The simulation will look like a game where you interact with the environment in a game-alike manner.

A simulator written on top of JMonkeyEngine.
